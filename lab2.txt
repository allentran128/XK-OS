CSE 451/Lab 2

1. Describe the relationship between scheduler, sched, swtch.

scheduler -
  One per cpu, handles the scheduling routine for that cpu.
    Picks what process to run,
    Runs it,
    Returns control to scheduler

sched -
  Calling sched will prompt the current running process to
  switch to the scheduler.

swtch -
  Assembly implementation of switching between a process and the
  scheduler.

Scheduler decides what process to run, it calls swtch to switch
control to that process. After the process finishes, or when
it needs to return control to the scheduler, it calls sched. The cycle repeats.

2. Describe why the child process is able to return to user-level
application where fork is called.

The child process essentially copied it's parent's proc struct
except for the pid. So when the scheduler decides to run the child,
it uses the copied mem_regions[CODE] and trap_frame->rip to resume
where it was in executing instructions. Then trapret restores the
trap frame contents to the CPU registers, calls iretq, and the new
user process begins executing where fork was called in the parent.

3. How does process kill work in xk? What is its relationship to exit?

Kill takes a pid and marks that pid's process to be exited as soon as that
process is rescheduled. Then exit() is called from the kernel execution context
of the target process itself. Basically, kill causes the target process
to exit itself.
