step through creating a file to see if it is in the correct place

also, add support for writing beyond 1 block (512 bytes)
   where it reads from next, et.
   check how inodes do that

dirent[] at buf(rootino.data[0].startblbkn) and traverse
if there are null entries(free)
   keep in mind the nblock number as limit to how far you look


try appending '\' to file names after fixing above

clean; run qemu look at debugger statments

look into the structure of root
   ls doesnt work => is root corrupted
   might solve issue of filei

redo writei
